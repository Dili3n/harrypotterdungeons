Follow the development of my Harry Potter dungeon !

I am a young computer developer more particularly in python. I started this year and I want to share with you my first project. made with pygame.
Sorry if the code is messy, I will do my best to improve! : D

Being a Harry Potter fan I decided to make a "Dungeon" game in the Harry Potter universe. The goal is to recover 7 Horcrux to be able to fight a boss.
I made a first version which just uses the python terminal. But I wanted to go further and show what I could do with Pygame.
